Hey there! My name is Summer Blanco (she/they) and I'm a 2nd year PhD student in the Plant Biology department at UGA. I am an early career Plant Evolutionary Biologist interested in color variation in plant sexual organs.

Iâ€™m also passionate about science communication and diversifying the STEM higher education community. As a queer, Latinx person, I have spent a lot of time reflecting on my own experiences in higher education, which has naturally led to several leadership and advocacy roles during my academic career.

Outside of the academy, I love roller skating, ceramics, and a good oat milk latte.
